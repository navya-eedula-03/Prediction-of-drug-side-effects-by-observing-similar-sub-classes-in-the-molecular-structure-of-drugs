# Prediction of drug side effects by observing similar sub-classes in the molecular structure of drugs

*Requirements before running the Notebook*

A few models in the notebook require that it is run using GPU runtime.
The datasets, drug_SMILES_750.csv and data1.txt must be loaded into the /content folder

*Libraries*
networkx : bipartite, degree_centrality, closeness_centrality, betweenness_centrality, projected_graph
matplotlib
nxviz : CircosPlot
torch
torch_geometric : RandomLinkSplit, GCNConv, negative_sampling,
sklearn : StandardScaler, roc_auc_score,
torchdrug : datasets, core, models, tasks

*Installations with versions*
